# Weather-JS

I have created a weather app where you can enter any city name and you will get the weather information. I used **ES6 classes** and created different files for handling each operation. I've used **async await** for fetching API and **DOM** for displaying it. I also used **local storage** for storing this information in browser's local storage.
